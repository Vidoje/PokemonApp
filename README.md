# PokemonApp

In Kotlin part I have used MVVM pattern for getting the data from Pokemon API. In Java part I used Volley for fetching the data since I found it as quickest solution.

There are some things that need to be resolved:
	- I would make whole app in one language
	- Currently it's only allowed to see 20 Pokemons. That part should be fixed and allow user to see whole list of available Pokemons.
	- UI fixes
