# PokemonApp

In Kotlin part I have used MVVM pattern for getting the data from Pokemon API. In Java part I used Volley for fetching the data since I found it as quickest solution.

There are some things that need to be resolved:
1. I would make whole app in one language
2. Currently it's only allowed to see 20 Pokemons. That part should be fixed and allow user to see whole list of available Pokemons.
3. UI fixes
